    "text": "Sustainable agricultural landscapes\nHow can we intensify agricultural production in a sustainable way? Our lab investigates win-win-wins in the Canadian Prairies where producers, ecosystems, and climate all have the potential to benefit through a change in landscape management. Making fields messier (e.g., by adding or retaining non-crop vegetation), our lab has reported, can increase crop yields and support beneficial insect taxa. Our Prairie Precision Sustainability Network asks how farmers can use marginal croplands more efficiently. Co-locating ranching with solar panels, called agrivoltaics, is another exciting project in our lab.\n\n\n\nAgricultural landscapes in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are extensive, where crop fields have a footprint of &gt; 500,000 km2. Making production more intensive (i.e., more food on less land) will be critical in an era of global change. Non-crop vegetation, found in small isolated patches in fescue grassland (left) and parkland (right) ecoregions, may be a key lever."

    "text": "The challenge\n\nSustainable intensification of agriculture in the Canadian Prairies\nOur research is animated by the possibility that small changes to management in Canadian Prairie croplands (Figure 2) could lead to win-win-wins (i.e., mutually beneficial solutions for food production, biodiversity and climate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Annual crop fields (yellow) cover a footprint of ~500,000 km2 in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Alberta (AB), Saskatchewan (SK) and Manitoba (MB). That’s the same as covering France with only canola, wheat, barley and peas (and a few other crops). Achieving sustainable intensification across this vast region is a globally-significant challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy sustainable intensification? Finding ways to use less land to produce more food has received international recognition as a critical challenge to combat the climate crisis and safeguard biodiversity, while ensuring food security for all.\n\n\n\nFor example, we could make fields messier, by restoring or retaining perennial non-crop vegetation (Figure 1; left and right). Patches of vegetation like these supply ecosystem services to agriculture, and serve as habitats for biodiversity, potentially improving crop yields in neighbouring fields.\nOr, as our Prairie Precision Sustainability Network investigates, we can help farmers identify small parcels of low productivity land to remove from production, increasing profitability for the farmer, and creating new habitat and carbon sequestration opportunities when that land is restored in perennial plants.\nAgrivoltaics is another exciting project in our lab. Co-locating cattle ranching with solar panels in small arrays (&lt; 5 ha) helps to decarbonize our energy supply, and could have benefits for forage quality, soil health, and ecosystem services. In other words, maintaining food production while reducing impact."
