    "text": "Monitoring and surveillance\nWe love insects! (See Figure 1). So little is known about so many species. Our lab is working hard to change this, close to home, in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada.\nA major focus are the beneficial insects that provide ecosystem services. Our team has sampled at hundreds of sites (Figure 2). Back at the lab, sample processing (like this; Figure 3), followed by pinning specimens (like this; Figure 4) is a common activity for our undergraduate and graduate students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Between 2015 and 2021 the lab sampled bees, beetles, hoverflies, spiders, and other arthropods at 335 cropland sites across Alberta, Canada, for a total sampling effort of ~9000 trap-weeks. We curated over 200,000 beneficial arthropod specimens from this haul. The bee collection alone is among the largest (by specimen count) in Canada. Many specimens were identified by “visiting” taxonomists like bee expert Lincoln Best and coleopterist Dr. Manoj Kandoth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: From the field to the lab. Each jar represents a different sample, containing arthropods of many species.\n\n\n\nBiodiversity data are the basis of many recent lab publications. For example:\n\nPostdoc Dr. Abigail Cohen reported that wetlands found in the Canadian Prairies (known as “sloughs”) are important for several bumble bee species, particularly when wildflowers growing in their margins come into bloom [1].\nAnother of Abigail’s forthcoming papers will explore risks to bees and beetles in the region under changing climate conditions.\nMaster’s student Emily Purvis investigated the reassembly of bee communities following restoration of grassland-wetland complexes [2] and which wildflowers support the greatest bee diversity [3].\nPhD student, Dr. Danielle Clake, took our monitoring work to the Rockies and adjacent Selkirk Mountains, climbing 17 mountains three times each. One outcome of that effort was the identification of a new cryptic species of bumble bee using genomic methods. Danielle named the new species Bombus hibernus [4].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: One of many boxes of pinned insects in our collection. These come from traps placed near wetlands. Taxa shown include bumble bees, dragonflies, diving beetles, and others. After pinning, “easy” species are identified by us. But we’re not taxonomists, so we often recruit outside experts!"

    "text": "Arthropod ecosystem services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are ecosystem services?\n\n\n\nThese are nature’s contribution to people. Pollination, pest regulation and weed control are examples of ecosystem services where beneficial insects and arthropods play an outsized role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Wetlands, and other non-crop vegetation patches in prairie croplands, provide habitat for beneficial insects that supply ecosystem services. By sampling at various distances into the field, we have demonstrated spillover from these features into fields. This effect brings pollinators, pest regulation, and weed control ecosystem services closer to the crop.\n\n\n\nLab personnel have shown that non-crop vegetation near fields provides habitat for pollinators and for the natural enemies of crop pests. Spillover (Figure 5) of these arthropods has been a popular research topic for us. Some examples of our spillover research:\n\nIn a well-cited 2019 study, postdoc Dr. Jess Vickruck showed that native bees are more abundant closer to wetland margins [5], where they spillover (Figure 5) into crops. There they can supply pollination services to flowering crops, such as canola and alfalfa.\nDr. Sam Robinson, also a postdoc, discovered that beetles and other predatory arthropods move into and out of these habitats across the growing season, bringing them closer to where their service is needed [6].\nMSc student Tobyn Neame showed that predation frequency (as measured by sentinel prey caterpillars; Figure 6) is higher closer to non-crop vegetation [7], and that larger beetles are found further away from field edges [8], suggesting that the body size functional trait influences the spillover distance.\nBSc (Hons) student Rebecca Innes found that canola pests, at least late in the season, do not spillover from non-crop features [9], which has sometimes concerned farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Sentinel prey used to detect evidence of pest regulation spillover in crop fields. This plasticine caterpillar (from Tobyn’s research [7]) shows attempts by carabid beetles to bite it. Another approach, advanced by lab MSc student Sylvia Neumann, placed inviable moth eggs on tiny sticky cards. She then measured how many were eaten (not pictured).\n\n\n\nWhat next? Weed control! Many beetles are seed-eaters, and this ecosystem service may be mediated by proximity to non-crop vegetation. PhD student Tianyi Ren is working hard on this one.\nCan we predict arthropod ecosystem services better using functional traits? For example, like morphology or behaviour, that are not taxa-specific. Answering this second question is essential for generalizing beyond the region to gain global understanding of the mechanisms connecting biodiversity and ecosystem services."

Many specimens were identified by “visiting” taxonomists like bee expert Lincoln Best and coleopterist Dr. Manoj Kandoth.\nFigure 3: From the field to the lab. Each jar represents a different sample, containing arthropods of many species.\nFigure 4: One of many boxes of pinned insects in our collection. These come from traps placed near wetlands. Taxa shown include bumble bees, dragonflies, diving beetles, and others. After pinning, “easy” species are identified by us. But we’re not taxonomists, so we often recruit outside experts!\nFigure 5: Wetlands, and other non-crop vegetation patches in prairie croplands, provide habitat for beneficial insects that supply ecosystem services. By sampling at various distances into the field, we have demonstrated spillover from these features into fields. This effect brings pollinators, pest regulation, and weed control ecosystem services closer to the crop.\nFigure 6: Sentinel prey used to detect evidence of pest regulation spillover in crop fields. This plasticine caterpillar (from Tobyn’s research [7]) shows attempts by carabid beetles to bite it. Another approach, advanced by lab MSc student Sylvia Neumann, placed inviable moth eggs on tiny sticky cards. She then measured how many were eaten (not pictured).\nFigure 7: An outreach poster of native bees from Alberta, Canada in the University of Calgary collections.

I prioritize being a supportive mentor for my graduate students and trainees, and finding ways to innovate as a teacher.\nMy research has focused on sustainable agriculture, landscape ecology, ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, global change, and quantitative ecological methods. I have also spearheaded transdisciplinary research and courses that link ecology with the social sciences. I currently lead a multi-institutional research program in agricultural sustainability called the Prairie Precision Sustainability Network. As an advocate for sustainable agriculture on the Canadian Prairies, I have often been invited to speak on this issue to different types of audiences.\nI began my career as high school teacher (2001 to 2008), living and working in Indigenous communities in Ontario, Canada. This experience continues to inspire me, and it has shaped the design and philosophy of my undergraduate and graduate courses. Teaching well is very important to me. I strive to improve how we deliver post-secondary education and have introduced several novel teaching and assessment approaches in my courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ABC Lab is a collective project of Dr. Paul Galpern, Dr. Mindi Summers, and their students and trainees at University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\n\n\nImage content created by past or present lab members is credited; other images are licensed or are in the public domain; Lab logo and beetle line drawing by Tobyn Neame; Built with Quarto; Last content update: May 2024"

That’s the same as covering France with only canola, wheat, barley and peas (and a few other crops). Achieving sustainable intensification across this vast region is a globally-significant challenge.\n\n\n\nFor example, we could make fields messier, by restoring or retaining perennial non-crop vegetation (Figure 1; left and right). Patches of vegetation like these supply ecosystem services to agriculture, and serve as habitats for biodiversity, potentially improving crop yields in neighbouring fields.\nOr, as our Prairie Precision Sustainability Network investigates, we can help farmers identify small parcels of low productivity marginal land that they can stop cultivating, increasing profitability, and creating new habitat and carbon sequestration opportunities when that land is restored in perennial plants.\nAgrivoltaics is another exciting project in our lab. Co-locating cattle ranching with solar panels in small arrays (&lt; 5 ha) helps to decarbonize our energy supply, and could have benefits for forage quality, soil health, and ecosystem services. In other words, maintaining food production while reducing impact."

    "text": "Messy fields\nOur lab has shown that “mess” (e.g., perennial and non-crop vegetation near crop fields) offers a measurable benefit by boosting yields [1–3], and by providing ecosystem services to crops. We found that these naturalized habitats host beneficial insects that move into the crop and supply services such as pest regulation, pollination and weed control (for more, see Biodiversity projects).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A yield halo effect: a small increase in yield observable about 10 m to 75 m away from the field edge. We have shown this effect in several papers using different types of data (insurance [1], precision yield [3], satellite imagery/machine learning [2]). These findings are important, not because the halo is worth a lot of money (it’s not), but because they demonstrate non-crop patches can, under certain conditions, have a positive effect on crops.\n\n\n\nWe have also reported that canola yield surrounding messy patches can be higher. We have called this the halo effect (Figure 3). It is small, and not usually visible to the eye, requiring analysis of data to show that it is present [2–4]. Its cause remains an open question, but it may depend, in part, on soil moisture, the type of adjacent vegetation, and the abundance of bees, beetles and other beneficials hosted there.\nWhat’s next? We want to learn more about the halo effect. We’re just starting this journey. For example, how do moisture, vegetation type, patch size, arthropod ecosystem services, and soil fertility interact to create yield haloes? Wetlands and their vegetated margins are of particular interest. Can we value their contribution to crop yield as part of ecosystem service assessments?"

Farmers may seed parts of their fields year after year and find that these acres, perhaps due to soil conditions, produce too little yield to offset their input costs (like the seeds, fertilizer, herbicides, etc.).\nWhat if these areas were restored to perennial vegetation? Perenniality is a nature-based solution (NbS) for reducing greenhouse gases. When the land being converted is marginally profitable, it may may save the farmer money to stop seeding it. Messy places can also be habitats for biodiversity and supply many ecosystem services. Restoring marginal areas could therefore help rewild the Canadian Prairies while supporting climate objectives and (critically for implementation) improve the farmer’s bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Our Prairie Precision Sustainability Network collaborates with farmers to map marginal areas in crop fields across three prairie provinces. This prototype map illustrates the kinds of decision-support tools we are designing to help farmers make their fields messier.\n\n\n\nWe’ve been working hard with our PPSN research network colleagues (Figure 4) to bring together precision yield, satellite imagery, and economic data to identify parts of fields that have multi-annual net-negative profitability. Thanks to data shared by over 70 farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, we’ve built a tool that farmers across the region can use to help them visualize the marginally-profitable parts of their fields.\nWhat’s next? We’re going to work with farmers in the three prairie provinces to make fields messier (i.e., by restoring marginal areas to perennials). More on these exciting next steps very soon!"

This can help resolve the land use conflicts that may occur when solar projects compete with farmland. AV can also offset emissions from greenhouse gas (GHG) electrical generating facilities and enhance or sustain agricultural productivity. Alberta, Canada is a suitable location for this AV approach, as it has abundant pastureland and high solar generation potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: How AI imagines our Agrivoltaics Research Park (Adobe Generative AI).

This 10 ha co-location of bifacial solar panels and cattle pasture is a collaboration with Solartility.\n\n\n\nWorking with Solartility we’re creating an Agrivoltaics Research Park at University of Calgary’s W.A. Ranches. It will occupy less than 10 ha of land, have bifacial upright panels, and cattle will graze beneath the panels. A distributed network of these small footprint facilities could go a long way to reducing the carbon exposure of the electrical grid. AI thinks the site will look something like this (Figure 5). We’ll have real pictures after the site is operating in 2025.\nWhat’s next? The ABC Lab will lead the long-term environmental monitoring at this facility, researching the agricultural and environmental risks and benefits of constructing these facilities. Aligned with our agricultural sustainability theme, we will ask whether beef cattle agrivoltaics can be mutually beneficial for rancher livelihoods and for climate while minimizing impacts on the ranch environment.\n\nFunders\nWe thank the following funders for their support of our agricultural sustainability research, since 2015 (in alphabetical order):\n\nAlberta Conservation Association\nAlberta Innovates\nAlberta Canola\nDucks Unlimited Canada\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada\nManitoba Canola Growers\nMitacs\nNSERC\nSaskCanola\nSolartility\n\n\n\nSelected Publications from the lab\nSee more of our agricultural research publications here.\n\n\n[1] Galpern, P., Vickruck, J., Devries, J.

Here are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations of the 17 mountains former PhD student Dr. Danielle Clake climbed three times each. Bumble bee data collected at many of these is featured in [1]. The locations of sampling were selected a priori to create a gradient in land cover.\n\n\n\n\nLandscape complementation: PhD student Dr. Danielle Clake found that bumble bee species were more abundant at Rocky Mountain sites (Figure 1) when both forest for nesting, and meadows with wildflowers for foraging, were in close proximity [1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The design of our landscape pseudo-experiment where we identified 146 sites in Alberta croplands a priori across two gradients of complexity (patch richness, and contagion), and sampled bees at each for two years. We analyzed results for 213 wild bee taxa [2].\n\n\n\n\nLandscape complexity: We found, using a highly-replicated landscape “pseudo-experiment” (Figure 2), as expected, that locations with greater land cover heterogeneity support greater bee diversity. However, species differed dramatically in their numerical responses to land cover. We also found that time of year matters much more than landscape [2].\n\nWe also developed an “onion skinning” method that uses functional regression to describe landscape complexity (Figure 3). We used this to report locations in Alberta where increasing it might be most feasible [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: We introduced the method of onion-skinning in [3]. Landscape complexity at a focal location (white) is a vector of values representing proportional land covers in multiple annuli of different sizes. The resulting data is analyzed using a technique called function-on-scalar regression.\n\n\n\n\nLandscape connectivity: Whether organisms can move or disperse without resistance across landscapes has been the subject of several methods and applications papers by Paul Galpern (e.g., in 2011; [4]). More recently, in 2020, visiting scientist Dr. Alex Chubaty and BSc student (and whiz C++ programmer) Sam Doctolero, led the development of the grainscape package for R which models landscape connectivity by combining discrete patches and resistance surfaces [5]\nLandscape genomics: The DNA of organisms can sometimes capture the fingerprints of landscape connectivity when it reduces gene flow. Most recently Dr. Danielle Clake has led the lab in this regard (Figure 4), studying gene flow of bumble bees across elevation in her PhD thesis.\n\nOur earlier methodological work in landscape genomics (2014) led to the development of the MEMGENE package for R, software for the detection of spatial patterns in genetic relationships across landscapes. MEMGENE [6] has been used in dozens of published conservation studies internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A landscape genomics hypothesis for how differences in elevation and separation in geographic distance may collectively influence gene flow. This emerges in the genetic similarity of individual bumble bees, which for illustration purposes are shown using a colour gradient. Tested in Dr. Danielle Clake’s PhD thesis."

He used an elevational gradient in the Kootenays, British Columbia as a proxy for the phenological changes that are expected under climate change.
