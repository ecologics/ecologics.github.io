That’s the same as covering France with only canola, wheat, barley and peas (and a few other crops). Achieving sustainable intensification across this vast region is a globally-significant challenge.\n\n\n\nFor example, we could make fields messier, by restoring or retaining perennial non-crop vegetation (Figure 1; left and right). This patches supply ecosystem services to the surrounding fields, and serve as habitats for biodiversity.\nOr, as our Prairie Precision Sustainability Network investigates, we can help farmers identify small parcels of low productivity land to remove from production, increasing profitability for the farmer, and creating new habitat and carbon sequestration opportunities when that land is restored in perennial plants.\nAgrivoltaics is another exciting project in our lab. Co-locating cattle ranching with solar panels in small arrays (&lt; 5 ha) helps to decarbonize our energy supply, and could have benefits for forage quality, soil health, and ecosystem services."
