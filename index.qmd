### [Agriculture](projects_agriculture.qmd){style="text-decoration: none;"}

We study the sustainable intensification of agriculture, and explore whether changes to landscape management can lead to mutually beneficial solutions for food, farmers, biodiversity, and climate.

![[Learn more](projects_agriculture.qmd) about our research on agricultural sustainability, messy fields, "win-win-wins," precision farming, remote sensing, and agrivoltaics in the Canadian Prairies](images/agriculture_montage.png)

### [Biodiversity](projects_biodiversity.qmd){style="text-decoration: none;"}

We love bees, beetles and other invertebrates, and research the ecosystem services supplied by these species.

### [Conservation](projects_conservation.qmd){style="text-decoration: none;"}

We study the theory and the practice of conservation at landscape scales, with a focus on prairie, mountain, and urban ecosystems in western Canada.
