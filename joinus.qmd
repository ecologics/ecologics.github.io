![Four BSc Honours research students from the ABC Lab received awards at the undergraduate symposium in March 2024. We take on several undergraduate research project students every year, and we hold weekly group meetings for students to develop research skills, and practice giving research talks.](images/fig-undergrad-research.jpg)
:::

We work hard to create a research community in which everyone is welcomed and feels included.  We'd love to have you join us.

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions to [Dr. Paul Galpern](pgalpern.qmd) or [Dr. Mindi Summers](msummers.qmd).


#### Research Openings
(Current: March 19, 2025)

* [Undergraduate students:]{style="background-color: #FFFF00;"} We take on several University of Calgary undergraduate students for full-year research projects (e.g., BIOL ECOL ENSC ZOOL 528 or 530). Please contact Paul Galpern or Mindi Summers. We usually finalize our group for the fall during the summer.  Half-year opportunities (i.e., 507 courses) are also possible. Students must be prepared to spend 10 hours per week in the lab conducting research, and attend a weekly one-hour group meeting.

* [Summer field assistants:]{style="background-color: #FFFF00;"} Our application process for Summer 2025 field assistants is now closed. We'll need more assistants in Summer 2026. Please reach out in February 2026 for additional information.  We usually hire several field assistants each summer to work on the various projects in our lab.

* [Graduate students:]{style="background-color: #FFFF00;"} We're looking for PhD and possibly MSc students to work on topics related to sustainable agriculture, digital agriculture, beneficial insects, or agrivoltaics.  There are also exciting opportunities for students with background (or some basis to advance their learning) in remote sensing, machine learning, or statistical modelling.

* [Postdoctoral scholars]{style="background-color: #FFFF00;"} We have do not have an open position at this time. However, if you are interested in working on any of our projects, we would be happy to work with you to apply for fellowships or other funding.

We request that anyone interested in joining the lab email us with the following:

1. Unofficial transcripts
2. A brief statement of how your research interests interface with active research projects in the lab (e.g., in [agriculture](projects_agriculture.qmd), [biodiversity](projects_biodiversity.qmd), or [conservation](projects_conservation.qmd)).
3. A CV (not required for undergraduates)
4. Evidence of your written work (not required for undergraduates)
