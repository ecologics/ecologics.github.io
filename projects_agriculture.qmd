## The challenge {style="margin-top: 1rem;"}

##### Sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Canadian Prairies

Our research is animated by the possibility that small changes to management in Canadian Prairie croplands (@fig-prairie-crops) could lead to *win-win-wins* (i.e., mutually beneficial solutions for food production, biodiversity and climate).

![Annual crop fields (yellow) cover a footprint of \~500,000 km^2^ in the Canadian Prairie provinces of Alberta (AB), Saskatchewan (SK) and Manitoba (MB). That's the same as covering France with only canola, wheat, barley and peas (and a few other crops). Achieving sustainable intensification across this vast region is a globally-significant challenge.](images/prairie_crops.png){#fig-prairie-crops}

[Why sustainable intensification?]{style="font-weight: 900;"} Finding ways to use less land to produce more food has received international recognition as a critical challenge to combat the climate crisis and safeguard biodiversity, while ensuring food security for all.
:::

For example, we could make fields messier, by restoring or retaining perennial non-crop vegetation (@fig-agriculture-montage; left and right). Patches of vegetation like these supply ecosystem services to agriculture, and serve as habitats for biodiversity, potentially improving crop yields in neighbouring fields.

Or, as our [Prairie Precision Sustainability Network](https://www.prairiepsn.ca) investigates, we can help farmers identify small parcels of low productivity land to remove from production, increasing profitability for the farmer, and creating new habitat and carbon sequestration opportunities when that land is restored in perennial plants.

Agrivoltaics is another exciting project in our lab. Co-locating cattle ranching with solar panels in small arrays (\< 5 ha) helps to decarbonize our energy supply, and could have benefits for forage quality, soil health, and ecosystem services. In other words, maintaining food production while reducing impact.
